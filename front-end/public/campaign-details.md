# Forest Revival Initiative: Restoring Our Planet, One Tree at a Time

Welcome to the Forest Revival Initiative - a groundbreaking environmental conservation project that combines blockchain technology with real-world tree planting to combat climate change and restore biodiversity. This isn't just another fundraising campaign; it's an interactive journey where every donation plants real trees while you engage with our innovative tree planting game.

## 🌳 Our Mission

We're on a mission to restore deforested areas worldwide by funding strategic tree planting initiatives. Every dollar donated directly translates to trees planted, carbon offset, and wildlife habitat restoration. Through our interactive platform, you can watch your environmental impact grow in real-time while playing our engaging tree planting game.

## 🎮 Interactive Tree Planting Experience

Our unique approach combines traditional fundraising with gamification:

- **Click-to-Plant Game**: Plant virtual trees and watch your forest grow
- **Real-Time Impact Tracking**: See your carbon offset and forest area calculations
- **Achievement System**: Unlock milestones as you contribute to forest restoration
- **Seasonal Events**: Experience spring planting, summer growth, and autumn harvest
- **Wildlife Return**: Watch as native species return to restored habitats
- **Global Forest Progress**: Track restoration across different regions worldwide

## 🌍 Environmental Impact

Every donation makes a measurable difference:

- **$1 plants 10 trees** across deforested regions
- **Each tree offsets 22kg of CO₂** annually
- **25 square meters of forest** restored per tree
- **118kg of oxygen** produced per tree per year
